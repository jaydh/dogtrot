    <p>
      University of Washington Mathematics graduate with background in
      programming, scientific computing, and education. Passion for technologies
      used to give people the wherewithal to communicate and access information.
    </p>
    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
      Projects wispy: wispy.jaydanhoward.com | github.com/jaydh/wispy
      (Typescript, React, Redux, ImmutableJS, Firebase) – Responsive
      productivity hub driven by data analytics which manages daily tasks and
      webcontent consumption. Key features include embedded article viewer with
      automatic bookmark synching, cloud storage, metadata scraping, data
      analytics on content consumption. Transition Probability Analysis in
      League of Legends (Matlab, Python) - Designed and implemented modular
      simulation using Markov chains for statistical analysis of dynamic player
      compositions, behavior, and strategy. Included multiple components of game
      including diverse champion stats, champion skills, and game objectives in
      cohesion with gameplay strategies and transient states. Data Analysis
      Final (Matlab) - Designed and implemented a handwriting intepreter to
      process and categorize images of handwritten letters with 95% accuracy.
      Implemented various statistial techiniques to analyze pixel density in
      images to differentiate handwritten letters.
